## What is Artificial Intelligence Governance?
AI governance is the processes, policies, and principles that are established to ensure that artificial intelligence technologies are designed, developed, and used in an ethical and responisble manner.


## Goals of AI Governance:
- Promote ethical use of AI technology
- Improve transparency, manage risk, and ensure accountability
- Protect public interest and minimize negative impact of AI on society 
- Drive innovation 


AI governance is a rapidly evolving field and there is ongoing debate about the best way to approach it. Some organizations are developing internal AI governance frameworks, while others are advocating for industry-wide standards and regulations. In any case, AI governance is becoming an increasingly important issue as AI becomes more widespread and its impact on society becomes more apparent.
